## Problem & Needs

The availability of land is a critical factor in the development of new commercial projects. However, municipalities and companies seeking to expand or relocate face increasing space constraints, particularly in metropolitan areas. To promote sustainability, the net resealing of commercial areas should be minimized, making the reactivation of underutilized sites—so-called brownfields—an essential strategy. These sites offer several advantages, as they are often already integrated into local supply networks, benefit from established infrastructure, and are easily accessible for employees.

Despite their potential, a major challenge remains: the lack of centralized and comprehensive data on the location, availability, and potential contamination of brownfields. While some municipalities maintain detailed records, others rely on fragmented and inconsistent information, making the efficient redevelopment of these sites more complex. Without a systematic approach, the full potential of brownfield revitalization remains underutilized.

Addressing this gap aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and supports the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable" [UN SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Specifically, Target 11.3 promotes sustainable urbanization and efficient land use, aligning directly with brownfield redevelopment by preventing unnecessary urban sprawl. In the European Union, policies such as the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) actively support brownfield redevelopment to enhance environmental sustainability and economic revitalization ([commission.europa.eu](https://commission.europa.eu/ec-events/brownfield-redevelopment-eu-2019-04-05_en)). Implementing a structured approach to brownfield identification and assessment will enhance environmental responsibility, promote economic revitalization, and foster social well-being by transforming underutilized land into productive, sustainable spaces.

## Solution Capability

The Brownfield Recovery Potential (BRP) Capability is the service which provides the answers to the above questions related to brownfields as described in the following. The service may be tried out free of charge at pre-commercialization stage because of sponsorship provided by [ESA Network of Resources](#network-of-resources-\(nor\)).

### BRP Map

The BRP Capability provides a thematic map product generated on-demand for a customer-selected, geographic Area of Interest (AoI) that may span a municipality, a region or an entire country. This map is intended to make the search for locations and areas much easier and, in the interests of soil and climate protection, to direct the need for space to locations that have already been used, in particular to relieve pressure on the “green meadows” on the outskirts of town.

The BRP map contains the location and size of the places that are most likely classified as brownfields enriched with further meta- and geo-data. The backbone of the applied classification method is a ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained on remote sensing imagery via TorchGeo. To enhance its performance for industrial land-use classification, the model was fine-tuned on a dataset of thousands of annotated images. 

#### Overview of the BRP Interactive Map

The Brownfield Recovery Potential (BRP) Interactive Map is a geospatial web based tool designed to identify and analyze underutilized commercial sites (brownfields) across Austria. This initiative aligns with Austria’s sustainability policies by promoting the redevelopment of brownfields instead of increasing urban sprawl.

Developed as a free and open service by Umweltbundesamt (UBA) Austria’s Federal Environment Agency, in collaboration with Fraunhofer IIS,  the BRP map identifies approximately 5,700 commercial locations exceeding 1,000 m², making them prime candidates for redevelopment.

### Key Benefits & Relevance:

* Economic Revitalization: Encourages investment in underutilized areas and reduces infrastructure costs.  
* Smart Urban Planning: Provides data-driven insights for integrating brownfield redevelopment into municipal frameworks, fostering climate-resilient commercial hubs.

### BRP APIs

The BRP map is accessible through two specialized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure seamless integration into geospatial platforms. The primary interface is the OGC Web Map Service (WMS), a standardized protocol that enables dynamic streaming and visualization of map layers. This allows for cascaded integration into widely used Geographical Information Systems (GIS) such as QGIS, facilitating easy access and overlay of BRP data within existing workflows. While the current approach prioritizes geospatial standards, a REST API could be considered as a future development to enhance accessibility and interoperability based on user needs.

### Download

BRP Maps can also be offered for download as files from an access controlled sFTP Server as GeoPackage (GPKG), an open, non-proprietary, platform-independent standard, building on existing standards, for storing geospatial data (vector and raster data) in a file. 

### Delivery Process

The delivery process for the BRP Capability involving Customer and Provider(s) is shown in the following workflow.

### Remote Sensing Imagery

The BRP Capability exploits Very-High-Resolution remote sensing data either aerial orthophotos or satellite acquisitions. Two alternatives are offered by the producer: (1) The Customer provides these imagery (e.g. from an open government data repository) or (2) the Provider caters for the procurement of such data at additional cost from commercial sources.

### Disclaimer

The BRP Capability grants no guarantee that all potential brownfields or brownfields will be completely recorded. The tool cannot be used as a classic real estate portal; nor can it answer whether the space is currently available or not. Instead, it can offer quick and, above all, up to nationwide guidance as to which regions have potential areas that may be worth taking into account when determining a location.

The tool cannot answer whether the identified property is actually available or whether it is actually a brownfield site. Please consider this fact before placing an order. 

The updatedness of the BRP Map information depends on the acquisition date of the remote sensing imagery used during its production. The acquisition date is shown in the meta data provided by the BRP Capability. The providers of the tool cannot guarantee that information is regularly updated as this lies entirely within the responsibility of the respective Customer.

Remote Sensing Imagery: For extended Areas of Interest the commercial procurement offered by the BRP Capability Provider might become unrealistically expensive and possibly not feasible within a reasonably short period of time.
