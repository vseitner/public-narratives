## Features

* **High-quality**: Powered by the latest generation of AI-technology, the solution provided by N Vision enables automatic mapping of solar panels at very high accuracy. 
* **Quality Assurance**: In case of remaining failures, human validation is performed to ensure high-quality data across the region of interest.
* **Up-to-Date**: By capturing and analyzing recent imagery, the extracted data represents the status-quo of deployed solar energy. 
* **Cost & Time Efficient**: This approach is up to 6x more cost and time efficient compared to traditional approaches.
* **Fast & Scalable**: Large datasets are handled efficiently, making it ideal for projects of any size.

## Product Description

As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, efficient and accurate mapping of solar installations becomes increasingly essential. N Vision's advanced geospatial software solution offers a time and cost efficient approach to map solar panels. 

Using AI-based computer vision algorithms and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery, this service delivers precise and actionable data. This technology empowers downstream planning institutions to optimize the deployment and management of solar energy systems, helping drive the transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.

## Accuracy

For mapped solar panels, N Vision aims to achieve **95% or higher in both precision and recall**. Efficient data validation workflows are embedded to ensure high quality data.

## Add-Ons

Optionally, panels can be classified into photovoltaic vs. solar heat. In addition, the panel’s angles and orientations can be derived with given depth data.

## Deliverables
Customers will receive the full set of mapped solar panels and belonging attributes. Further, a report with insightful KPIs of the extracted data is provided.

## Data Access
The extracted data will be shared in standard GIS files (e.g. Geopackage or GeoJSON). Additionally, the data can be fetched from N Vision's API to automatically integrate the results into workflows.

## Disclaimer

Due to the nature of using ortho imagery, only solar panels which are visible in the images can be extracted (e.g. solar panels mounted on vertical facades or occluded ones cannot be mapped). The accuracy of mapped solar panels depends on the quality of the source imagery. The higher the quality and resolution of the images, the higher the accuracy of the extracted data. During manual validation, no onside validation is performed. Validation is performed using ortho-imagery only.

## Pricing

N Vision's goal is to provide fair offers which are tailored to customer’s specific needs. In order to get a customized quote, please reach out to Gerhard Neuhold (contact details below).

## Ortho Imagery

If no recent ortho imagery is available for the areas of interest, N Vision supports in acquiring required datasets.

## Free Samples and Demos
