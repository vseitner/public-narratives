### Advanced AI-Powered Building Detection
The Building Footprints service leverages cutting-edge AI technology for accurate building detection and segmentation. Our system employs the SAM-Adapter model (Segment Anything Model with domain-specific adaptation) to precisely identify and segment buildings in diverse urban environments. This approach has been validated for effectiveness in challenging scenarios, including refugee settlements where building detection is particularly complex. 

The technical workflow includes:
*	Processing high-resolution satellite imagery through our adapted SAM-Adapter pipeline
*	Generating building masks in GeoTIFF format and building polygons as ShapeFiles
*	Implementing binary semantic segmentation optimized for remote sensing applications
*	Continuous model improvement through regular training with diverse urban datasets

This methodology builds on recent research (Gao, 2024)[^1] that demonstrated the effectiveness of SAM-Adapter for humanitarian applications in refugee camp settings, which we've extended to broader urban environments.

[^1]: Gao, Yunya. "Leveraging Segment Anything Model in Identifying Buildings within Refugee Camps (SAMRefugee) from Satellite Imagery for Humanitarian Operations." _arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.11381_ (2024).

The system maintains high accuracy across various building types and densities while providing regular updates through our automated monitoring pipeline, ensuring that urban development changes are captured promptly and accurately.
This is shown in the following example, a screenshot (Imagery Â© Google, accessed via QGIS QuickMapServices plugin, 2025. Google.):

For the same area, the Pleiades image (0.5m resolution) ordered by ubicube shows that there have been significant changes.

The building footprints algorithm provides probability maps in a first step (colorful). Comparison to existing building stock data shows huge differences.

### 3D Building Stock Integration

The Building Footprints service is evolving toward comprehensive 3D urban modeling by integrating our current 2D detection capabilities with surface and elevation data. This advancement will enable:

* Complete building stock updates with height and volumetric information
* Detailed 3D city models for advanced urban planning
* Improved analysis of urban density and skyline changes
* Enhanced solar potential assessment based on roof geometry

This integration leverages digital surface models (DSM) and digital terrain models (DTM) to extract building heights and shapes, creating accurate 3D representations of urban environments. The resulting models will support more sophisticated applications in urban planning, energy efficiency analysis, and smart city development.

## Use Cases
The Building Footprints service supports various stakeholders:
### Real Estate Developers
* Site analysis and development potential assessment
* Urban growth pattern analysis
* Infrastructure planning support

### Urban Planners

## Pricing Model 
Our business model is based on square kilometers of analyzed area. As we focus exclusively on the built environment, we employ advanced spatial clustering algorithms to minimize the area of interest, creating an optimal trade-off between coverage and cost.
We offer a two-step approach to building footprint monitoring:
1.	*Monitoring based on Copernicus Sentinel II data*: This cost-effective solution covers wide areas and focuses primarily on change detection. This approach is particularly valuable for the GTIF capability "urban heat islands - trend analysis," where understanding changes in the built environment helps predict heat island trends.
2.	*Detailed extraction from high-resolution data*: This premium service provides precise building footprints, detects new buildings, identifies changes to existing structures (such as extensions), and recognizes obsolete buildings.

Both approaches can be combined in a workflow where changes are first detected using the monitoring service, and detailed information is extracted only for areas of interest. A decision layer can be implemented between these steps to trigger detailed extraction only when a certain threshold of changes is detected.
Our pricing structure depends on the selected modules:
*	Low for monitoring services
*	Medium for footprint extraction, with pricing dependent on the required precision
*	Premium for services requiring human validation

### Free Version
